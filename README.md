# Digit Recognition using Gradio and MNIST Dataset
This project demonstrates how to build a digit recognition application using Gradio and the MNIST dataset in Jupyter Notebook.

## Description
The digit recognition application uses Gradio, a user interface library for machine learning models, to create an interactive canvas for users to draw digits. The application then uses a Sequential model trained on the MNIST dataset to predict the digit drawn by the user.

## Features
* Interactive canvas for drawing digits
* Pre-trained Sequential model for digit recognition
* Easy-to-use interface with Gradio

## Installation
To run this application, you will need to install the following libraries:

* Gradio
* TensorFlow
* Numpy

You can install these libraries using pip:
```
pip install gradio tensorflow numpy
```
